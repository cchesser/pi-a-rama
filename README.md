# pi-a-rama

A simple repository of learning languages and exploring Ï€. The goal of
this repository is to explore other languages, starting with trivial
examples of printing the value of pi, and then expanding to other
approaches to compute to a larger number of precision.

* [go](go/pi.go) - Simple example of printing pi (`go run pi.go`).
